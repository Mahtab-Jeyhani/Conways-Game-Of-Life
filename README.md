# Conway's Game Of Life
This is my final project for Theory of Computation in the third semester of university.
John Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automation, a zero-player game made in 1970. Everything's happening on a finite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells.

## Description
Each square (or "cell") on the grid can be either alive or dead, and they evolve according to the following rules: <br />

+ Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (referred to as underpopulation)
+ Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (referred to as overpopulation)
+ Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives unchanged to the next generation.
+ Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors comes to life.

## Controls
LEFT CLICK - you can make a cell "active"/"alive" by left-clicking it
RIGHT CLICK - to "kill" a cell
SPACE - start/stop
c - clear/reset
